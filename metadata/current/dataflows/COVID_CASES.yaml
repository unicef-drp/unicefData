  values:
  - Data on COVID-19 cases and deaths by age and sex are only available for a limited
    number of countries for the time period 2020-2022. Where data exist, quality varies
    widely and reporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths may be incomplete or suffer
    from low coverage. Additionally, to develop standardized age-disaggregated data
    some redistribution and recalculation methods have been applied. Due to the rapidly
    evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and limitations in data collection systems,
    data may also be out of date by the time of publication. These data should be
    interpreted with caution and may deviate substantially from the true number of
    COVID-19 cases and deaths in a subset of countries with limited data.
